- 👋 Hi, I’m @jyuwaaw
- 👀 I’m interested in Digital IC Design, And potential Analog ICs in the future cuz I was admitted to Samueli School of Engineering of UCI
- 🌱 I’m currently working on low-power design method based on the timing error resilience of deep neural network, which was close to computer architecture researh rather than pure IC designs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects! Accumulating exps as if live was a game~ haha
- 📫 How to reach me, I wonder if we can DM on GitHub.
